Network Optimization Simulator

Network Optimization Simulator is an interactive project focused on visualizing network topologies, routing paths, and traffic flow using graph-based models and optimization algorithms.

The project combines graph theory, optimization techniques (such as genetic algorithms), and real-time browser-based visualization to provide an intuitive and extensible environment for studying network behavior and routing efficiency.

Overview

The simulator represents a computer network as a graph consisting of heterogeneous node types and weighted edges. Each node corresponds to a network entity (PC, compute node, server, storage, gateway), while edges represent communication links characterized by latency and bandwidth.

The system is designed to visualize both static network structure and dynamic processes such as optimized routing paths and packet-level traffic flow.

Key Features
Interactive Network Visualization

Force-directed graph layout with physics-based stabilization

Multiple node types with distinct shapes and colors

Optimization Concept

The simulator is intended to visualize results generated by optimization algorithms, primarily genetic algorithms.

Typical optimization objectives include:

Minimizing end-to-end latency

Avoiding overloaded network links

Balancing traffic distribution

Identifying robust and efficient routing paths

At the current stage, optimization results are loaded from static JSON files. The architecture is designed to support live optimization updates via a backend service.
